# Day 1: 2025-10-18

## What I Learned
- Created goal_tracker.py to log daily learning hours
- Learned about file operations with 'a' mode (append)
- Understood functions, conditionals, and file I/O
- learned float vs str [float for math purpose and string for use as it is]
- about if,elif,else
- use of print(f"") vs print()
- use of cd~(open specific path) mkdir (create folder) rmdir(remove/delete) touch(create file) nano(open file) ls(list on the specific folder)



## Code I Wrote
- File: goal_tracker.py
- Purpose: Track daily learning hours, calculate stats, log to file

## Struggles
- Understanding difference between 'a', 'w', 'r' file modes
- Figuring out TypeError (comparing float to string)
- Git push authentication with PAT

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Learn loops (for and while)
- Build streak counter program

# Day 2: 2025-10-19

## What I Learned
- for loops with range()
- while loops
- Combining loops + if statements
- Python indentation rules (4 spaces = 1 level)
- Debugging IndentationError and SyntaxError

## Code I Wrote
- File: counter.py (10-day learning tracker + weekly hours)
- File: milestone_tracker.py (30-day streak with milestones)

## Struggles
- IndentationError appeared multiple times
- Confused = (assignment) with == (comparison)
- Forgot colons after if statements
- Understanding when to indent and how much

## Breakthrough Moments
- Realized spacing IS part of Python code
- Successfully debugged 4 different errors on my own
- Combined loops + conditionals for first time

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Learn about lists and data structures
- Build a task manager that stores multiple items
